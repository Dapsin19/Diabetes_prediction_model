# Diabetes_prediction_model
This project leverages Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) using PyCaret to build a classification model for diabetes prediction. The best-performing algorithm was the Random Forest Classifier, used to determine whether a patient is likely to be diabetic based on input features.
